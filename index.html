        <h1intro>WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?</h1intro><br>
            I offer translation, editing, and proofreading services and deliver quality, well-researched documents that will help you break down language barriers. There's a tremendous market waiting to hear your message, and it speaks English. You could bring your business to the U.S. or get published in <journaltitle>Psychological Science</journaltitle>.<br><br>
<unavailable>!!! I am completing a master's program in translation studies at the moment and am unavailable to take on large projects !!!</unavailable><br><br> 
        <h1intro>WHAT KIND OF STUFF DO YOU WORK WITH?</h1intro>
            <ul>
                <li>Research articles, books of levels of specialization, textbooks for high school and college students, and other documents like assessment scales in the fields of <b>psychology</b> and <b>linguistics</b></li>
                <li>Administrative translation, which covers documents related to management work and could range from something like a company's internal newsletters and communication to a manual on employee training </li>
                <li>Technical specification sheets, user guides, operation manuals, etc. Straightforward stuff, but requires very specific terminology!</li>
                <li>Brochures, signs, maps, menus, etc for those in the tourism industry</li>
                <li>Small websites or personal texts, such as letters or postcards</li>
				<li>I also hope to add non-fiction literature to this list, anything from biographies to self-help books and instructional guides to informational blogs</li>
            </ul>
        <h1intro>WHY SHOULD I TRUST YOU WITH MY RESEARCH/USER MANUAL/WEBSITE?</h1intro><br>
			<p>Born in the U.S. to a Venezuelan and Spanish family, I am a native speaker of both languages. Second-generation Spanish-speakers are very common in the U.S., but so many of them are unable to cultivate their family's language and maintain a certain level of native fluency. My parents did a great job sending me overseas to Venezuela and Spain and creating a home environment that helped me maintain that relationship with the Spanish language. By the American school system,  I have an excellent command of the English language, and through my family and personal effort, my comprehension skills in Spanish are equal to native monolingual speakers.</p>
			<p>I studied psychology and linguistics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, have worked as project manager and consultant in nutrition labs, psychology labs, and even a pediatric office, and am now completing a master's program in translation studies in Barcelona. Because of these many opportunities I've been fortunate enough to find, I have the resources to cover a fairly <b>wide range of topics.</b></p>
        <h1intro>I'VE GOT A PROJECT FOR YOU! HOW MUCH WILL IT COST?</h1intro><br>
            Just below you'll find a general range of rates and prices for the services I offer. The final rate will vary based on aspects like how you would like your product delivered, whether your text is in a Word doc or embedded in an image, or how dense the subject matter is. I charge a higher rate for a research article than I would for your BnB's brochure.
